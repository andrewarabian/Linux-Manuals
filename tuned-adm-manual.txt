  TUNED & TUNED-UTILS MANUAL (RHEL / FEDORA / CENTOS STREAM)
======================================================================

tuned-adm is a cpu tuning tool which is great for server optimizations.

1. INSTALLATION
----------------
    sudo dnf install tuned tuned-utils

Enable and start tuned:

    sudo systemctl enable --now tuned
    systemctl status tuned    # verify daemon is active

======================================================================

2. BASIC COMMANDS
----------------
    tuned-adm list                  # list all profiles
    tuned-adm active                # show active profile
    sudo tuned-adm profile <name>   # switch to <name> profile
    tuned-adm recommend             # get system recommendation
    tuned-adm profile_info          # show details of active profile
    tuned-adm off                   # disable tuned completely

======================================================================

3. HOW TO ACTIVATE A PROFILE
----------------
Example: switch to latency-performance

    tuned-adm list
    sudo tuned-adm profile latency-performance
    tuned-adm active
    tuned-adm profile_info

Ensure tuned stays enabled on reboot:

    sudo systemctl enable --now tuned

You can change profiles anytime â€” new settings apply immediately.

5. BEST USE CASES
----------------
=== LAPTOPS / DESKTOPS ===
    balanced            -> Default, safe for most users
    balanced-battery    -> Best for extending laptop battery life
    desktop             -> Responsive desktop workloads
    powersave           -> Extreme power saving, reduced performance

=== SERVERS (GENERAL) ===
    throughput-performance -> Great default for general servers
    latency-performance    -> Best for databases, game servers (e.g. Minecraft)
    accelerator-performance -> More aggressive throughput tuning

=== NETWORK SERVERS ===
    network-latency     -> VOIP, trading, low-latency network apps
    network-throughput  -> Bulk transfers, storage, 40G+ NICs

=== HPC / SCIENTIFIC ===
    hpc-compute         -> High-performance scientific jobs
    latency-performance -> Predictable performance for compute nodes

=== CLOUD / VIRTUALIZATION ===
    aws                 -> Optimized for EC2
    virtual-guest       -> Inside a VM
    virtual-host        -> Hypervisors

=== SPECIALIZED ===
    intel-sst           -> Intel CPUs with Speed Select Technology
    optimize-serial-console -> Minimal tuning for serial console servers

======================================================================

6. VERIFYING EFFECTS
----------------
Check applied tunables:

    tuned-adm profile_info

Inspect common changes manually:

    cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
    blockdev --getra /dev/sda
    sysctl -a | grep vm.dirty_ratio

======================================================================

7. CUSTOM PROFILES
----------------
System profiles are located in:
    /usr/lib/tuned/

Custom profiles should be placed in:
    /etc/tuned/

Example:
    sudo mkdir /etc/tuned/myprofile
    sudo cp /usr/lib/tuned/balanced/tuned.conf /etc/tuned/myprofile/
    vim /etc/tuned/myprofile/tuned.conf
    sudo tuned-adm profile myprofile

======================================================================

8. TROUBLESHOOTING
----------------
Check logs:
    journalctl -u tuned

Reset tuned:
    tuned-adm off
    sudo tuned-adm profile balanced

Conflicts:
    Other tools (like cpupower) may override CPU governors.

======================================================================

9. QUICK REFERENCE
----------------
    tuned-adm list
    tuned-adm active
    tuned-adm recommend
    sudo tuned-adm profile <name>
    tuned-adm profile_info
    tuned-adm off

======================================================================

10. REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES
----------------
Laptop (battery saving):
    sudo tuned-adm profile balanced-battery

Desktop (responsive):
    sudo tuned-adm profile desktop

Minecraft server (reduce tick lag):
    sudo tuned-adm profile latency-performance

Database server (low latency I/O):
